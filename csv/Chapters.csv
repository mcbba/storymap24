Submissions were added to this list in the order they were recieved. As you scroll down the list you will see lots of awesome volunteer submitted photos of what they saw in their block along with a little backstory on their photo. The pins represent the center point of a survey block, they <b><u>do not</u></b> represent bird locations. All identifying information on sensitive species has been removed.

This year there were two COHA nests within 25 feet of each other, kind of unusual I think. I've been watching these two nests all season and havent seen any activity for many weeks. Then, last Friday, both of them had fledglings getting ready to depart! At the first nest, I first saw a bird on the nest, mistaking it for an adult. At the second nest, a young bird perched on the edge looking right at me. When I looked again at the first nest, the bird was scrambling around in nearby branches. When I went by a hour later, I didnt see either bird and thought they had fledged but my husband saw them both again the next day! He took this photo on Sunday morning. Of course they'll be gone for good soon. ",14,Plain,blue,6-3,38.09377,-122.85937,,,,,

I live in Larkspur and we have several birdhouses in our yard.  The Oak Titmouse, Chestnut-back Chickadees and White-breasted Nuthatches, have occupied them during the breeding season. This year a pair of Violet-green Swallows flew around the yard checking out 3 different boxes. One of the boxes was still occupied by White-breasted Nuthatches.  As soon as the last nuthatch fledged, I believe it was the same day, the swallows began moving in! The White-breasted nuthatch was still trying to defend the box, while the swallows were bringing in nesting material and in-between I observed a Pygmy Nuthatch checking out the home as well! I guess the breeding birds in Marin also have bidding wars on the real estate of Marin! ",14,Plain,blue,13-19,37.92711,-122.54688,,,,,

The family is obviously unconcerned about the presence of inebriated out otherwise human's. There were 5 chicks in this wee nest and one was continually pushed to the back so it looked like there were 4 jammed in the nest. The adult flew in over my head and was at the nest for an instant before flying of to return a few minutes later. Block 6-21 which includes Bear Valley has been thouroughly surveyed and show's an amazing variety of species.,14,Plain,blue,6-21,38.03127,-122.79688,,,,,

The Bel Marin Keys Great Egret/Great Blue Heron colony (monitored by ACR and now by SFBBO) was subsequently abandoned for a variety of reasons. These birds had to relocate and one of the locations chosen was ""Bird Island"" in one of the nearby lagoons. On April 24th, 2024 a Great Horned Owl nest was observed right next to 4 Great Egret nests in a dead conifer. This nest was successful and on June 1st an Egret was observed on this nest, on July 6th there were 2 downy GREG chicks in this nest. I may write a more complete story if anyone is interested?

Randall House is a hotspot for breeding activity, there are Cliff Swallows, Starling, Brewer's Blackbird, Black Phoebe and maybe Bluebirds if the Starlings are not dominating the cavities in the dead trees in the backyard. The Starlings, Blackbirds or both have nests inside the house which is a maternity roost for Townsend's Big-eared Bats.

They sat quietly but then started quivering and became agitated. An adult flew in, stuck its bill into the beak of one of them to give it an insect, then quickly flew off. The babies calmed down but again became agitated when they detected the approach of an adult. Each baby was fed at least once during our approximately 20 minutes of observation.

I told her about the quail and my concern that there were only four chicks. She then showed me hidden within a bush on a retaining wall, a nest with eggshells. A few days before finding that, she had seen a female quail nearby.  What a discovery!  According to Cornell’s Birds of the World, quail eggs hatch synchronously, and the parents do not remove the hatched shells from the nest. Do these eggshells and downy feathers indicate a successful hatching, a failure to develop (see egg on left), predation, or a combination of fates? One of the most enjoyable aspects of this project has been meeting residents, sharing information with them about birding and the survey and as a bonus, hearing about their observations.",14,Plain,blue,12-17,38.07294,-122.54688,,,,,

Last year I got a glimpse and a bad photo of one, so I went back to that spot several times this year.  Merlin kept calling out Allen’s along with Anna’s. I saw an Anna’s but could not confirm the Allen’s. On a trip in May, I again could not confirm Merlin’s repeated IDs despite leaving the site and returning 4 times. Feeling discouraged, I went a quarter of a mile further along the trail and found this guy!  He was very cooperative, posing for at least 18 minutes and at one point displaying his tail. Apparently, another birder found strong breeding evidence, so Allen’s is now a confirmed breeder in this block. Thanks!",14,Plain,blue,9-12,38.01042,-122.70313,,,,,

I was ready to report 100s of Purple Martin, then on closer observation the 100s of swallows were mostly Cliff Swallows (Merlin picked up Barn swallow also but I didn't spend any time trying to find any in this mixed flock). It was fantastic to be amongst all this avain activity. Some of the new fledglings landed in the bushes nearby and I got this photo.
